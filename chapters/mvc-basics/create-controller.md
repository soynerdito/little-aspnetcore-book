## Crear un controlador

There are already a few controllers in the project's Controllers folder, including the `HomeController` that renders the default welcome screen you see when you visit `http://localhost:5000`. You can ignore these controllers for now.

Create a new controller for the to-do list functionality, called `TodoController`, and add the following code:

**`Controllers/TodoController.cs`**

``` csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace AspNetCoreTodo.Controllers
{
    public class TodoController : Controller
    {
        // Actions go here
    }
}
```

Routes that are handled by controllers are called **actions**, and are represented by methods in the controller class. For example, the `HomeController` includes three action methods (`Index`, `About`, and `Contact`) which are mapped by ASP.NET Core to these route URLs:

```
localhost:5000/Home         -> Index()
localhost:5000/Home/About   -> About()
localhost:5000/Home/Contact -> Contact()
```

There are a number of conventions (common patterns) used by ASP.NET Core, such as the pattern that `FooController` becomes `/Foo`, and the `Index` action name can be left out of the URL. You can customize this behavior if you'd like, but for now, we'll stick to the default conventions.

Add a new action called `Index` to the `TodoController`, replacing the  `// Actions go here` comment:

```csharp
public class TodoController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        // Get to-do items from database

        // Put items into a model

        // Pass the view to a model and render
    }
}
```

Action methods can return views, JSON data, or HTTP status codes like `200 OK` or `404 Not Found`. The `IActionResult` return type gives you the flexibility to return any of these from the action.

It's a best practice to keep controllers as lightweight as possible. In this case, the controller should only be responsible for getting the to-do items from the database, putting those items into a model the view can understand, and sending the view back to the user's browser.

Before you can write the rest of the controller code, you need to create a model and a view.
