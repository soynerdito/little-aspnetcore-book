## Crear una vista
Views in ASP.NET Core are built using the Razor templating language, which combines HTML and C# code. (If you've written pages using Jade/Pug or Handlebars moustaches in JavaScript, ERB in Ruby on Rails, or Thymeleaf in Java, you've already got the basic idea.)

Most view code is just HTML, with the occasional C# statement added in to pull data out of the view model and turn it into text or HTML. The C# statements are prefixed with the `@` symbol.

The view rendered by the `Index` action of the `TodoController` needs to take the data in the view model (an array of to-do items) and display it as a nice table for the user. By convention, views are placed in the `Views` directory, in a subdirectory corresponding to the controller name. The file name of the view is the name of the action with a `.cshtml` extension.

**`Views/Todo/Index.cshtml`**

```html
@model TodoViewModel;

@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Manage your todo list";
}

<div class="panel panel-default todo-panel">
  <div class="panel-heading">@ViewData["Title"]</div>

  <table class="table table-hover">
      <thead>
          <tr>
              <td>&#x2714;</td>
              <td>Item</td>
              <td>Due</td>
          </tr>
      </thead>
      
      @foreach (var item in Model.Items)
      {
          <tr>
              <td>
                <input type="checkbox" name="@item.Id" value="true" class="done-checkbox">
              </td>
              <td>@item.Title</td>
              <td>@item.DueAt</td>
          </tr>
      }
  </table>

  <div class="panel-footer add-item-form">
    <form>
        <div id="add-item-error" class="text-danger"></div>
        <label for="add-item-title">Add a new item:</label>
        <input id="add-item-title">
        <button type="button" id="add-item-button">Add</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>
```

At the very top of the file, the `@model` directive tells Razor which model to expect this view to be bound to. The model is accessed through the `Model` property.

Assuming there are any to-do items in `Model.Items`, the `foreach` statement will loop over each to-do item and render a table row (`<tr>` element) containing the item's name and due date. A checkbox is also rendered that contains the item's ID, which you'll use later to mark the item as completed.

### The layout file
You might be wondering where the rest of the HTML is: what about the `<body>` tag, or the header and footer of the page? ASP.NET Core uses a layout view that defines the base structure that the rest of the views are rendered inside of. It's stored in `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`.

The default ASP.NET Core template includes Bootstrap and jQuery in this layout file, so you can quickly create a web application. Of course, you can use your own CSS and JavaScript libraries if you'd like.

### Customizing the stylesheet

For now, just add these CSS style rules to the bottom of the `site.css` file:

**`wwwroot/css/site.css`**

```css
div.todo-panel {
  margin-top: 15px;
}

table tr.done {
  text-decoration: line-through;
  color: #888;
}
```

You can use CSS rules like these to completely customize how your pages look and feel.

ASP.NET Core and Razor can do much more, such as partial views and server-rendered view components, but a simple layout and view is all you need for now. The official ASP.NET Core documentation (at `https://docs.asp.net`) contains a number of examples if you'd like to learn more.
