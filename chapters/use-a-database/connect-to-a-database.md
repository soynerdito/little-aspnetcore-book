## Conectar a una base de datos

There are a few things you need to use Entity Framework Core to connect to a database. Since you used `dotnet new` and the MVC + Individual Auth template to set your project, you've already got them:

* **The Entity Framework Core packages**. These are included by default in all ASP.NET Core projects.

* **A database** (naturally). The `app.db` file in the project root directory is a small SQLite database created for you by `dotnet new`. SQLite is a lightweight database engine that can run without requiring you to install any extra tools on your machine, so it's easy and quick to use in development.

* **A database context class**. The database context is a C# class that provides an entry point into the database. It's how your code will interact with the database to read and save items. A basic context class already exists in the `Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs` file.

* **A connection string**. Whether you are connecting to a local file database (like SQLite) or a database hosted elsewhere, you'll define a string that contains the name or address of the database to connect to. This is already set up for you in the `appsettings.json` file: the connection string for the SQLite database is `DataSource=app.db`.

Entity Framework Core uses the database context, together with the connection string, to establish a connection to the database. You need to tell Entity Framework Core which context, connection string, and database provider to use in the `ConfigureServices` method of the `Startup` class. Here's what's defined for you, thanks to the template:

```csharp
services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlite(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
```

This code adds the `ApplicationDbContext` to the service container, and tells Entity Framework Core to use the SQLite database provider, with the connection string from configuration (`appsettings.json`).

As you can see, `dotnet new` creates a lot of stuff for you! The database is set up and ready to be used. However, it doesn't have any tables for storing to-do items. In order to store your `TodoItem` entities, you'll need to update the context and migrate the database.
